Angelica Kauffmann
Swiss, 1741-1807
Praxiteles Giving Phryne His Statue
of Cupid, 1794
Oil on canvas
Angelica Kauffman painted this theme from antiquity
as one in a series of commissions for a British patron.
She had trained as an artist from a young age, working
as an assistant to her father, a muralist and painter.
They traveled extensively and settled in Rome when
she was a young teenager. Kauffman was a painter and
a musician, and became a member of Rome's vibrant
artistic community. Later, in London, she belonged to
an international circle of painters whose themes derived
from ancient history. In this intimate scene, the Greek
sculptor Praxiteles offers his favorite work, a statue of
Cupid, to Phyrne, his beautiful mistress.
