Spanish
Head of Christ or a Saint,
ca. 1220-1240
Oil with polychromy (colored paint)
The identity and architectural context of this
carved wooden head have not been clearly
determined, but its benevolent gaze and large
size suggest it may have adorned a medieval
church. Most likely made in a workshop where
wooden sculptures were carved and painted, the
head is roughly carved on its back, suggesting a
fixed placement in a niche or against a wall. Once
brightly painted, it was meant to be seen from a
distance. It may have been positioned in a church
along the route to the shrine of Saint James of
Compostela in Spain.
