Portrait of Auguste Vestris, 1793
Default on canvas
Metadata
The French dancer Auguste Vestris, the subject of
this portrait, was the son of King Louis XVl's dancing
master. Auguste made his own ballet debut at the
age of 12, soon usurping his father's reputation. This
portrait celebrates his slender form and fashionable
tastes. His close-fitting jacket, beaver-fur hat, silk
waistcoat, golden earrings, walking stick, and gloves
complete the look of a dandy.
Adèle Romany trained in Paris in a segregated studio
for women. She first contributed to the Paris Salon
in 1793, the year she painted Vestris, and over her
long career became known for depicting actors and
musicians. This representation demonstrates skillful
drawing and modeling, a refined sense of color, and a
talent for lively characterization.
